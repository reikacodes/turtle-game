# turtle-game
(my own version of the snake game)
Hello and Welcome to the Turtle Game!
The objective of this one-player game is to score as many points possible by chasing after the red target.
Here are the Rules: You cannot go outside of the screen or touch the other random barriers!
Each time you do, the game is instantly over, your score resets to 0, and another barrier will be added, making the game a little trickier!
Aim to beat your previous score! And most importantly have fun!
